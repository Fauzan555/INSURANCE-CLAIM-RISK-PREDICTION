# INSURANCE-CLAIM-RISK-PREDICTION

# 🚗 Insurance Claim Risk Prediction

This project predicts the probability of an insurance claim using Machine Learning, built for Property & Casualty Insurance analytics.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Insurance companies face financial risk due to unexpected claims.  
This project helps predict **claim likelihood** based on customer, vehicle, and safety features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Vehicle details
- Customer demographics
- Safety features
- Target: `claim_status` (0 = No Claim, 1 = Claim)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier (Final Model)
- Gradient Boosting

✔ SMOTE used to handle class imbalance  
✔ Feature importance used for interpretability

## 🚀 Deployment
- Built using **Streamlit**
- Deployed as an interactive web app

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Streamlit

## 📌 Business Impact
- Identifies high-risk insurance policies
- Helps insurers improve pricing & underwriting decisions
- Reduces claim losses
